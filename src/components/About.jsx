                Hi! Welcome to my personal portfolio ðŸ˜€. My name is Nicolas Aimar, a
                young Front-End Developer who loves to create things that live on the
                web. I have knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, Styled Components, Emotion, Bootstrap, Tailwind, JavaScript, React.js, Git, C# and Iâ€™m
                taking my first steps in Java, Python and Solidity.
                <br />
                <br />
                Before I started learning web development I obtained numerous
                certificates related to finance and capital markets until I became a
                Certified Financial Advisor (AFCÂ®). It is thanks to this that I worked for the argentinean stock broker 
                <a className="btoro" href="https://blacktoro.com.ar/" target="_blank"
                > Blacktoro.com.ar</a>.
                <br />
                <br />
                I consider myself an entrepreneur. This led me to found NorFitness in
                2018, a sports supplement selling venture, and co-founded Greenally in
                2021, a BaaS that provides a bridge between web 3.0 and businesses
                through blockchain-based tools and ethereum smart contracts, in order
                to achieve real utility and measurable benefits.
                <br />
                <br />
                Finally, my hobbies are CrossFit, family and friends.
